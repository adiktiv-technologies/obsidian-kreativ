# Obsidian Kreativ

Elevate your Obsidian experience with the power of local Large Language Models (LLMs). `Obsidian Kreativ`, an innovative plugin, transforms your note-taking by enabling dynamic interaction with content.

It leverages cutting-edge natural language processing to summarize, generate new ideas, and connect notes seamlessly, turning knowledge accumulation into a lively, interactive process. Incorporating local LLMs into Obsidian offers key advantages: Local processing enhances privacy and security, crucial for personal and professional knowledge management. Moreover, utilizing local LLMs eliminates the need for an OpenAI API key, allowing users to enjoy these advanced capabilities at no cost whatsoever.
