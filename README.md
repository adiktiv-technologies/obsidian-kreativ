# Obsidian Kreativ

Obsidian Kreativ brings privacy-first AI capabilities directly into your vault. It uses local Large Language Models powered by `transformers.js` — no cloud services, no API keys, and no external tools required.

Turn your notes into an active knowledge partner: ask questions, summarize content, generate ideas, and uncover connections — all on your own device.

## Features

* **Chat with Your Vault**
  Ask natural-language questions and get answers grounded in your notes.
* **Summarization & Extraction**
  Condense long documents into clear insights.
* **Idea & Content Generation**
  Brainstorm outlines, rewrite text, or draft content within Obsidian.
* **Smart Knowledge Linking**
  Reveal relationships between notes to strengthen your knowledge graph.

## Local-First by Design

* Runs fully on-device using `transformers.js`
* Zero API keys, zero internet dependency
* Enhanced privacy and data ownership
* Works offline — productivity anywhere

## Requirements

Nothing beyond Obsidian itself.
Models are downloaded and managed directly in the plugin settings.
